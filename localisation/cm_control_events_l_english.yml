 cm_control_events.1.d: "Hi and welcome to my choas mod!\nThe way the mod works is: As soon as you accept the event with a time frame of how often you want the events to fire, an event in the background will constantly repeat itself and will fire a random event on every cycle.\nThere currently are two possibilities: The event has a direct effect, like dropping your stability or the event gives you a modifier, like increasing national unrest. For the second one, the event you see will decide if the modifier you'll get will be positive or negative. So you could get lucky and it reduces you national unrest, or unlucky and you'll drown in rebels.\nYou can always choose to stop the eveent cycle by a decision. Just know that I will judge you for taking the easy way out!\n\nFirst of all you have to choose in what interval you want the CHAOS events to happen. You can modify this value later in the settings decision."
